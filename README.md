A simple website to get the weather. It will automatically grab your location and pull your local weather upon loading the page. If you wish to get the weather for a different location, there is a search bar on the top right to search for a specific city or state. The website will display the hourly forecast for the next 48 hours as well as a day summary for the next week. The website will also display any current weather alerts for your location.
